Iâ€™m a  majoring in Bioinformatics and Biostatistics who loves computer programming such as C(++), Java, Python and R, where I work to help labmate members learn and use programming to do better work in less time, with less friction, and (perhaps) more joy.

I love working with data scientists and statistician and Bio scientists who is skilled in quantitatice genetics across the spectrum- from beginners to advanced hackers- and particularly enjoy using software tools to create educational materials that enlighten and engage learners. Topics I teach range from python programming to machine learning. My teaching materials have been used by Student of Chung-Ang University, Seoul 06974, Korea, UCAS, Innovation Class@University of Beijing Forestry, and now IGDB Bailab Root Microbiome
